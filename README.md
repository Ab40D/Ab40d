<p align="center">
I build things that mix code with hardware.
Mostly front-end for now, moving full-stack, and always working on electronics, automation, and real projects.

### What I work with

- Front-end (JavaScript, React)
- Learning full-stack step by step
- Arduino & embedded stuff
- Automation (n8n, logic-based workflows)
- ZimaBoard experiments & home-lab style projects
- Electronics, electricity, sensors, control systems

---

### Tools & tech I use

JavaScript • React • HTML • CSS • Git  
Arduino • n8n • Linux  
Web + hardware + automation

---

### Right now

Building projects, breaking things, fixing them, and learning how systems actually work.

Trying to connect **web, automation, and electronics** into one skillset.
